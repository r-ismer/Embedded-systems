# Embedded-systems

This course is oriented hardware and interfaces. It presents in details the different parts of an embedded system based on micro-controllers and/or FPGA.

The introductory part present the overall of the course and some recall on VHDL. Some low level element are presented.
The first section describe a specific microcontroller, this year the MSP432 family, and some programmable interfaces. A simple Microcontroller is studied and its use is emphasized in the course with the help of laboratories. The MSP432, a modern very low power micro-controller is used as practical study case. It is based on an ARM Cortex M4F core.
The second section present the design of an embedded system on FPGA. FPGA hardcore and softcore embedded processors are described and used in laboratories. Conception methodology of some programmables interfaces architecture is put in application with practical works in VHDL on FPGA.
The different parts of an embedded system, with standards parallel and serial bus, processor bus (asynchronous, synchronous) common and divergent characteristics are specifically used.
The third section has the goal of the the comprehension of programmable interfaces and specifically master unit. LCD and camera controller will be realized as exercises and laboratory.
The fourth section and last section will be a mini-project combining the topics studied along the previous sections. As example, this experiment allows the students to be able to design a master programmable interface on FPGA. A LCD display or a camera module is interfaced by a DMA controller on the FPGA. The ARM-A9 can access the FPGA as a specific accelerator or programmable interface.

Groups of laboratories are associated with each main topics.
At the end of semester, students will be able to design an embedded system based on micro-controller and FPGA. Design parts in VHDL and program it in C.
