# Lab 1: MSP432

The objective of this laboratory is to understand how to operate some of the programmable interfaces
available on a microcontroller (specifically on the MSP432 family, available on the TI LaunchPad
board).
This laboratory is divided into 3 sessions, and the final experiment is to be able to convert an analog
signal to a digital one using the Analog to Digital (A/D) converter available on the LaunchPad.
The microcontroller should output a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal with a width that is
proportional to the provided analog input. An oscilloscope and/or a logic analyzer will be used to display
the PWM output as well as other useful signals.
